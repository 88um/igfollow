# instagram-auto-follow
Auto follows a list of instagram users

**Login, choose your target list, choose how many people to follow, choose your follow speed and sit back.**

Script uses InstagramAPI library, which is a nice, simple shortcut. The logging is quite annoying though.

There are a few options when gathering users to follow:

  **Gather users from an instagram account's followers/following**
    
    - This method works for public pages/any page you follow
    
    - Ideal for follow-4-follow type of growth strats
    
  **Gather users from an external list (followlist.txt)**
    
    - This method is good if you have a pre-determined list of targets to follow
    
    - Simply add your list to the txt file attched in this repository (new username for each line)

Feel free to mess around with the sleep times when following, wether to increase or decrease is up to you.

**Exceptions include, but are not limited to: action blocks, challenge blocks.**

These can be caused by too many follows in a given amount of time, use the script in moderation and you should be good.
